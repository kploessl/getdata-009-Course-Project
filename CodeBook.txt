New variables created for the final Summary Data set:
- ActivityName (taken from Activity label data)
- SubjectID (taken from the Subject label data)
- I have retained the original names of each of the variables from the original dataset, but they now reflect the measurement aggregated at the level of ActivityName and SubjectID

R packages required to run the code:
plyr
dplyr
reshape2
